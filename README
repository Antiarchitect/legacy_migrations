LegacyMigrations
================

NOTE: This plugin is in its pre-embryonic stage. 
      Several people showed an interest in stackoverflow,
      so i started implementing it.

The objective is to create a ridiculously simple
syntax for migrating data from one data structure to
another. The example below should be relatively
self-explanatory.

Example
=======

  #In some file in your rails app (perhaps db/seeds.rb?)

  require 'legacy_migrations'

  transfer_from Person, :to => Animal do
    from :name, :to => :pet_name
    from :sex, :to => :gender
    ...
  end


  #OR, copy all columns with the same name

  transfer_from Person, :to => Animal do
    match_same_name_attributes
  end
